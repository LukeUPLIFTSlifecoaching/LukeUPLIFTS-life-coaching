    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <p>Hi, I'm Luke, based in Cambridge, UK. My journey into mentoring started from a personal battle with depression, anxiety and ADHD, this sparked a deep interest in me, urging me to help others overcome challenges like, mental health, depression, anxiety and many more of lifes daily struggles I've seen impact so many lives and my own. I'm connecting with local groups like the Cambridgeshire Adult ADHD Support Group and the Cogwheel Trust to ensure my approach is supportive and grounded in real community needs.</p>
    <p>I believe in 4 step program, this breaks the journey down into achievable steps to build lasting change. With a focus on future goals rather than past struggles, I use techniques like motivational interviewing to empower you. As I build my credentials, I'm committed to ongoing learning and feedback from experts in the field.</p>
    <p>What sets me apart? A genuine, empathetic style that makes sessions feel like a conversation with a friend. Let's work together to create the life you deserve.</p>
